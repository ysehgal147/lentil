# Lentil

## Brief Intro

Indian Males/Husbands are not able to identify different Indian Lentils because of their lack
of work experience in the Kitchen.

Some Indian Lentils have a similar look in terms of color and grain size, so it is natural for a
beginner to get confused between different varieties.

Apple's CreateML Library could be used to train an Image Classifier Program to detect
different Lentils using the Images of Texture of Different Lentils.
